# TinyC-Compiler
This is the repository for the CS39003 - Compiler Laboratory under the Department of Computer Science and Engineering for the Autumn Semester 2022-2023.

This repository contains six assignments. Assignment 3 to 6 constitute the project "tinyC compiler". tinyC is the subset of c.

All the code in this repository is written by me or my partner for the assignments.
