# TinyC-Compiler
This is the repository for the CS39003 - Compiler Laboratory under the Department of Computer Science and Engineering for the Autumn Semester 2022-2023.

This repository contains code for Assignment-6 that constitutes the project "tinyC compiler". tinyC is the subset of c.

All the code in this repository is written by me and my partner for the assignment.
